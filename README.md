# FundamentalAnalysis

Many market analysts believe that predicting market’s stocks fluctuations is nearly impossible to achieve due to the number of variables involved, especially since many of these variables are based on irrational factors such as human sentiment, with intricately hard to model interactions between them. However, there’s an alternative known as technical analysis, which unlike the aforementioned analysis only takes in consideration the values over time of a given stock to predict its patterns, unfortunately the downside of this approach is that the more reliable you require the predictions to be, the least frequent is the event of the stock fitting into a highly selective criteria that would ensure the predictability accuracy. A large part of the reasons why forecasting based on fundamental analysis is extremely challenging is the amount of data needed to be processed to come up with accurate forecasts, rendering the process itself unattainable by human means. but thanks to today’s machine learning models we can rely on computers to process different forms of data. In this paper, I’ll explain how Natural language processing and sentiment analysis are used with both unsupervised and supervised machine learning models to achieve promising results in the field of market stocks forecasting.
